# todoList

rewritten from jQuery: https://github.com/m019m1/todoList

native JS todo list

it's editable

it's auto-grow (grows vertically with more tasks)

it's auto-save (auto-save all your tasks (and its condition: made or not) in local storage)

it's responsive (resize it horizontally by pulling the right-bottom corner, or by changing the width of window)
